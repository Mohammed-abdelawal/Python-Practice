Write a Python program, square_root.py, that prompts for a positive integer n >= 2.  The program computes the square root of n and then keeps taking the square root of the resulting value, until the value is < 2.  The program prints the value (rounded to 4 decimal digits) each time the square root is taken. 

You should use the math.sqrt() function for computing the square root and the built-in function round() for rounding.
