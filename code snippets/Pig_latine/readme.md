You are trying to have a private conversation with your best friend but your annoying baby brother is eavesdropping. To thwart that little brat, you decide to converse in Pig Latin! However, your Pig Latin isn't very fluid so you need to write a program to help you translate English to Pig Latin.

The rules for translating from English to Pig Latin are as follows:

* 1- If a word begins with a vowel, append "yay" to the end of the word.
* 2- If a word begins with a consonant, remove all the consonants from the beginning up to the first vowel and append them to the end of the word. Finally, append "ay" to the end of the word.
We will consider the following letters to be vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y

For example:

* dog -> ogday
* scratch -> atchscray
* is -> isyay
* apple -> appleyay

The program shall ask the user to enter the text to translate. You can assume that this text consist only of words, separated by spaces. There will be no punctuation to deal with.
