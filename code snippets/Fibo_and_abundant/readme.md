Write a Python program that can:
* 1- Print the first n1 >= 2 numbers in a Fibonacci sequence (one number per line). 
* 2- Print all abundant numbers in the range 1 to n2 (one number per line), 
In both cases, you should use a for loop for the implementation. 

At the beginning of the program, the user is asked if he/she wants to see 1. or 2. or both (this input does not need to be error checked).  The program then prints out the information accordingly.

Make sure you think about and write down an algorithm for the problem before you start coding!

Your program should have the name fibo_abundant.py.  Starter code is given.

You are only allowed to use material from chapters 0-3 when solving this assignment.  Notice also that you are not allowed to use the sum() function.

Definitions:

In the Fibonacci sequence, the first two numbers are 0 and 1, but thereafter each number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers.  For example, the first 8 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. A proper divisor of an integer n are all integers that can divide n, except n itself.  For example, the integer 12 is an abundant number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, for a total of 16 (greater than 12).
